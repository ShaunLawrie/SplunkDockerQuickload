# Custom Splunk Apps
Drop Splunk apps as unarchived folders in here.  
These apps will be compressed into tgz format and automatically deployed to the Splunk docker image.  
If you edit an app inside the Splunk UI and want to save the changes you need to run the Build.ps1 command with the -PullFromDocker flag.
